# From Neurons to ChatGPT: A Complete Guide to Neural Networks and Large Language Models

If you already understand traditional machine learning — supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning — you have a better starting point than most people. You know that machines can learn patterns from data. But somewhere between "a model that classifies emails as spam" and "a model that writes poetry, debugs code, and holds a conversation," something dramatically changed. This post is about what that something is.

## 1. The Limits of Traditional Machine Learning

Traditional machine learning works beautifully when the problem is well-defined and the data is structured. You have features, you have labels, you train a model, and it learns a mapping. A decision tree, a random forest, an SVM — these are powerful tools. But they all share one fundamental assumption: **the input can be represented as a fixed set of features**.

Feed a house price predictor the square footage, number of rooms, and location — it works. But feed it a sentence like *"The bank was steep and muddy after the rain"* and ask it what the word "bank" means in context — it falls apart. Language is not a fixed feature vector. It is sequential, contextual, ambiguous, and infinitely variable.

Traditional ML also struggles with:

- **Variable length inputs** — sentences are not all the same length
- **Long range dependencies** — the meaning of a word can depend on something said ten sentences earlier
- **Context sensitivity** — the same word means different things in different contexts
- **Generation** — traditional models classify or regress, they do not generate new content

These limitations are not bugs. They are fundamental design constraints. To solve them, researchers had to rethink how machines process information from the ground up. That rethinking produced neural networks — and eventually, large language models.

## 2. Neural Networks — The Intuition

The brain processes information through billions of neurons. Each neuron receives signals from other neurons, does something with them, and either fires or stays quiet. Neural networks are a very loose computational analogy of this idea.

A single artificial neuron does three things:

1. Takes in a set of numbers as input
2. Multiplies each input by a weight (how important is this input?)
3. Adds them up, applies an activation function, and produces an output

That's it. One neuron is useless. But stack millions of them together in layers, and something remarkable happens — the network can learn to approximate almost any function.

> *Description: A single artificial neuron showing inputs x1, x2, x3 with weights w1, w2, w3 flowing into a summation node, followed by an activation function, producing output y.*

### Layers

A neural network is organised into layers:

- **Input layer** — receives the raw data
- **Hidden layers** — where the actual learning happens; the network builds internal representations
- **Output layer** — produces the final prediction or generation

The more hidden layers a network has, the "deeper" it is — hence the term **deep learning**. Depth allows the network to learn increasingly abstract representations. Early layers might detect edges in an image. Middle layers detect shapes. Later layers detect faces. This hierarchical feature learning is what makes deep networks so powerful.

### Weights and Training

Every connection between neurons has a weight — a number that determines how strongly one neuron influences another. At the start of training, these weights are random. The network makes terrible predictions. Training is the process of adjusting those weights to make better predictions.

This is done through:

- **Forward pass** — data flows through the network and produces a prediction
- **Loss function** — measures how wrong the prediction is
- **Backpropagation** — the error is sent backwards through the network, and each weight is adjusted slightly to reduce the error
- **Gradient descent** — the algorithm that decides how much to adjust each weight

After thousands or millions of iterations over the training data, the weights settle into values that allow the network to make accurate predictions. The network has "learned."

## 3. The Evolution — From Perceptron to Transformer

The history of neural networks is not a straight line. It is a story of breakthroughs, long winters of scepticism, and sudden explosions of capability. Understanding this history explains why LLMs are built the way they are.

### 1958 — The Perceptron

Frank Rosenblatt built the first trainable neural network — the Perceptron. It could classify simple patterns. It had one layer. It could not learn non-linear functions. Critics quickly showed its limitations, and interest collapsed. This was the first AI winter.

### 1986 — Backpropagation

Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams popularised backpropagation — the algorithm that made training multi-layer networks practical. Suddenly networks could learn complex patterns. Interest revived. But compute was still too slow and data too scarce to train deep networks at scale.

### 1997 — Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs

For sequential data like text, standard feedforward networks have a problem — they process each input independently, with no memory of what came before. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** solved this by feeding the output of each step back as input to the next step, giving the network a form of memory.

But RNNs had a critical flaw: **vanishing gradients**. When training on long sequences, the error signal becomes so small by the time it reaches the early steps that those early weights barely update. The network effectively forgets distant context.

**Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)**, introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997, solved this with gating mechanisms — special structures that explicitly control what the network remembers, what it forgets, and what it outputs at each step. LSTMs became the dominant architecture for language tasks throughout the 2000s and early 2010s.

> *Description: Side by side comparison. Left: an unrolled RNN showing hidden state h being passed from step to step across a sequence of words. Right: an LSTM cell showing the forget gate, input gate, cell state, and output gate with labeled arrows.*

### 2014 — Attention Mechanism

Even LSTMs struggled with very long sequences. The further back in a sequence an important word was, the harder it was for the network to use it. In 2014, Bahdanau et al. introduced the **attention mechanism** — an idea that would change everything.

The intuition is simple: instead of compressing the entire input sequence into a single vector, let the model look back at all previous words at every step and decide which ones are most relevant right now. When translating a sentence, the model can "attend" to the relevant source words directly, regardless of how far back they appeared.

Attention gave networks a direct line to any part of the input. Distance no longer mattered.

### 2017 — The Transformer

In 2017, Google researchers published a paper titled *"Attention Is All You Need."* The title was the thesis: you do not need recurrence at all. You do not need LSTMs. Attention alone is enough — and it is faster, more parallelisable, and more powerful.

The **Transformer** architecture was born. It processes the entire sequence at once rather than one word at a time. Every word attends to every other word simultaneously. This makes Transformers dramatically faster to train on modern hardware (GPUs and TPUs love parallelism) and dramatically better at capturing long-range dependencies.

The Transformer is the foundation of every major language model today — GPT, BERT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA. All of them are, at their core, Transformers.

## 4. What Makes an LLM Different

A **Large Language Model** is a Transformer-based neural network trained on a massive amount of text with one deceptively simple objective: **predict the next token**.

That's it. Given the sequence *"The cat sat on the"*, predict that the next token is likely *"mat"* or *"floor"* or *"roof."* Do this billions of times across hundreds of billions of words from the internet, books, code, and scientific papers — and something extraordinary happens.

### Scale Changes Everything

This is the insight that surprised even the researchers who built these systems. When you scale a language model — more parameters, more data, more compute — it does not just get better at predicting the next word. It develops **emergent capabilities** that nobody explicitly trained it for:

- It learns to reason through problems step by step
- It learns to write code in dozens of programming languages
- It learns to translate between languages it was never explicitly told were related
- It learns to follow instructions, explain concepts, and maintain conversation context

These abilities were not programmed. They emerged from the training process itself, at sufficient scale. This is one of the most surprising and debated phenomena in modern AI.

### Tokens, Not Words

LLMs do not process words directly. They process **tokens** — chunks of text that might be a whole word, part of a word, or a single character. The text is first broken into tokens by a tokeniser. Common words like "the" are one token. Rare words like "neuroscience" might be split into two or three tokens. This allows the model to handle any text, including words it has never seen before, by breaking them into familiar sub-parts.

A large model like GPT-4 has a context window of tens of thousands of tokens — meaning it can "see" and reason over a very long stretch of text at once.

### Parameters

The "large" in Large Language Model refers to the number of parameters — the weights in the network. GPT-2 (2019) had 1.5 billion parameters. GPT-3 (2020) had 175 billion. Modern models are estimated to have hundreds of billions to over a trillion parameters. Each parameter is a number. The entire "knowledge" of the model is encoded in these numbers, learned during training.

## 5. The Transformer — The Engine Inside Every LLM

You do not need to understand the mathematics to understand the Transformer intuitively. Here is the core idea.

### Self-Attention — The Key Idea

Imagine you are reading the sentence: *"The trophy didn't fit in the bag because it was too big."*

What does "it" refer to? The trophy or the bag? You immediately know it is the trophy, because you understand that "too big" relates to fitting, and the trophy is the thing that needs to fit. You resolved this by attending to multiple parts of the sentence simultaneously and weighing their relevance.

Self-attention is the mechanism that allows a Transformer to do exactly this. For every word (token) in the sequence, self-attention computes a relationship score with every other word. Words that are highly relevant to each other get high scores. The model then uses these scores to build a richer, context-aware representation of each word.

The word "bank" in *"I went to the bank to deposit money"* will develop a completely different internal representation than "bank" in *"The river bank was covered in reeds"* — because the surrounding words it attends to are different.

> **IMAGE: self-attention-example.png**
> *Description: A sentence "The trophy didn't fit in the bag because it was too big" with colored lines connecting "it" to "trophy" (thick line, high attention weight) and "it" to "bag" (thin line, low attention weight). Labels show attention scores as percentages.*

### Multi-Head Attention

A Transformer does not run self-attention once. It runs it multiple times in parallel — each time with different learned weight matrices. Each "head" learns to attend to different types of relationships. One head might learn syntactic relationships (subject-verb agreement). Another might learn semantic relationships (synonyms, antonyms). Another might track coreference (what pronouns refer to). The outputs of all heads are combined.

### Feed-Forward Layers

After attention, each token's representation passes through a feed-forward neural network — a standard set of layers that applies further transformations. This is where much of the model's factual knowledge is thought to be stored.

### Positional Encoding

Unlike RNNs, Transformers process all tokens simultaneously. This means they have no inherent sense of order. To fix this, a **positional encoding** is added to each token's representation before processing — a signal that tells the model where in the sequence each token appears.

### Stacking It All Together

A full Transformer stacks many of these blocks — attention + feed-forward — on top of each other. GPT-3 has 96 such layers. Each layer refines the representations produced by the previous layer. By the final layer, each token's representation encodes not just what the token is, but its full meaning in context, informed by everything else in the sequence.

## 6. How ChatGPT and Claude Are Built on Top

A raw Transformer trained only on next-token prediction is powerful but not particularly useful as an assistant. It will complete your text in the style of whatever it was trained on — but it will not follow instructions, answer questions helpfully, or avoid harmful outputs. Building a useful assistant requires additional training steps.

### Step 1 — Pre-training

The model is trained on a massive corpus of text — web pages, books, code, Wikipedia, scientific papers. This is computationally expensive, taking weeks or months on thousands of specialised chips. The objective is purely next-token prediction. By the end of pre-training, the model has a deep statistical understanding of language and a vast amount of world knowledge encoded in its weights.

### Step 2 — Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)

Human trainers write examples of ideal conversations — a question and a high-quality answer. The model is fine-tuned on these examples to learn the format and style of being a helpful assistant. This step teaches it to respond to instructions rather than just continue text.

### Step 3 — Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

This is the step that transforms a language model into a genuinely useful assistant. Human raters compare multiple model outputs and rank them from best to worst. A separate model — called a **reward model** — is trained to predict these human preferences. The language model is then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning to produce outputs that score highly according to the reward model.

RLHF is why ChatGPT feels different from earlier GPT models. It is why the model refuses harmful requests, stays on topic, and gives structured, helpful answers. The model has been shaped by human feedback at a deep level.

Stage 3: "RLHF" shows human rankers rating model outputs, a reward model being trained on rankings, and the language model being updated via PPO (reinforcement learning).*

## 7. What LLMs Can and Cannot Do

Understanding LLMs requires separating what they actually do from what they appear to do.

### What they actually do

At the most fundamental level, an LLM predicts the most likely next token given everything that came before. It does this using patterns learned from training data. When it appears to "reason," it is generating text that looks like reasoning — because reasoning-shaped text appeared frequently in its training data and was reinforced during RLHF.

This is not a dismissal. The outcomes are genuinely impressive. But it is important context.

### What they are good at

- **Text generation** — coherent, fluent, contextually appropriate writing
- **Summarisation** — condensing long documents into key points
- **Translation** — between languages, between styles, between levels of formality
- **Code generation** — writing, explaining, and debugging code
- **Question answering** — retrieving and synthesising information from their training
- **Instruction following** — carrying out complex multi-step tasks described in natural language
- **Reasoning tasks** — many forms of logical, mathematical, and common-sense reasoning (with limitations)

### What they struggle with

- **Factual reliability** — they can confidently state things that are false, a phenomenon called **hallucination**. They do not have a fact-checking mechanism; they have a plausibility-maximising mechanism.
- **Real-time knowledge** — they have a training cutoff. Events after that date are unknown to them unless provided in context.
- **Precise arithmetic** — basic maths is often fine, but complex calculations are unreliable without tools
- **Genuine understanding** — this is philosophically contested, but LLMs do not understand language the way humans do. They process statistical patterns.
- **Consistency** — the same question asked differently can produce different answers

### The Stochastic Parrot Debate

Some researchers argue that LLMs are "stochastic parrots" — sophisticated pattern matchers that mimic understanding without possessing it. Others argue that the distinction between "pattern matching at sufficient scale" and "understanding" is not as clear as it seems. This debate is ongoing and genuinely unresolved. What is clear is that LLMs are powerful tools whose capabilities and limitations need to be understood clearly by anyone using them.

## 8. Where Things Stand Today

The field is moving at a pace that makes any specific claim about state-of-the-art models outdated within months. But some broader trends are worth noting.

**Multimodality** — models are no longer text-only. GPT-4V, Gemini, and Claude can process images, audio, and in some cases video alongside text. The Transformer architecture generalises remarkably well to other data types.

**Longer context windows** — early models could handle a few thousand tokens. Current models handle hundreds of thousands. This enables tasks like analysing entire codebases, reading full research papers, or maintaining very long conversations.

**Smaller, more efficient models** — the race is not only toward larger models. LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi have shown that carefully curated training data and architectural improvements can produce highly capable models at a fraction of the size of GPT-4.

**Agents** — LLMs are increasingly being used not just to generate text but to take actions: browsing the web, writing and executing code, calling APIs, and completing multi-step tasks autonomously. This is an active and rapidly developing area.

## Summary

The journey from traditional machine learning to large language models follows a clear logic. Traditional ML hit fundamental walls with language — variable length, context sensitivity, generation. Neural networks provided a more flexible framework. RNNs added memory. Attention added the ability to look anywhere in a sequence. The Transformer combined attention with parallelism to create something trainable at unprecedented scale. And at sufficient scale, with the right training objectives and human feedback, these models developed capabilities that nobody fully anticipated.

Understanding this progression does not require mathematics. It requires understanding why each step was necessary — what problem it solved and what new problem it revealed. The history of deep learning is, in that sense, a remarkably coherent story of researchers following the evidence wherever it led.
